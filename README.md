# qrcode_labels
Print QR Code Labels for moving boxes.

I created this small program because I had needed to move and I had a ton of 6-per page, 3 1/3" x 4" labels (Avery: 94215, 5164, and many others) laying around unused.
I also had a bunch of 30-per page, 1" x 2 5/8" labels (Avery: 5160, 8460 and others).

I found an app for my phone called QRbox that created labels for a different style label that I did not have, but it also allowed you to use your own labels.
I didn't want to go buy more labels so I made this. Perhaps it will come in handy for someone else.
